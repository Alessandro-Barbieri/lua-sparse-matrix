pumice - a sparse matrix linear algebra library for Lua

Pumice is a sparse vector and sparse matrix library for the
[http://www.lua.org Lua] programming language. Pumice can efficiently
store vectors and matrices containing a large number of zero
elements. While it can be used as a general purpose matrix library,
emphasis is placed on being able to efficiently handle and perform
calculations with large sparse structures.

All code is currently written entirely in Lua, with vectors and
matrices being Lua tables "under the hood." While Lua is widely
considered to be one of the fastest dynamic languages, performance
will never be in the same ballpark as that of a highly optimized
sparse matrix library written in Fortran or C.  Still, Lua presents a
simple, accessible platform for exploration and experimentation.

Pumice currently has support for basic matrix operations, LU, QR, and
Cholesky decompositions, and for solving Ax = b using Gaussian
elimination with partial pivoting and with conjugate gradients, although,
with the exception of basic matrix operations, not necessarily in a
manner optimized for sparse matrices.  Another important limitation is
that currently there is no support for complex numbers,
although adding support for them should be fairly simple once the API
has stabilized.  It is also possible to import and export matrices in
[http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html Matrix Market]
format. More functions will be added as time and knowledge permit. The
library is released as free software under the terms of the MIT
open source license. Pumice's principle author is
